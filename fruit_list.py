### In this practice we will learn to make a list and to print each item on it on a new line.

fruit_list = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'mangos'] #First we made a list and for that we'll use '[]' in our variable.

for fruit in fruit_list: #Then we made a loop when every fruit on the list will be printed on a new line.
    print(fruit)
