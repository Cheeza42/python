### This task is an easy one. We made a multiplication script.
number = int(input("Please insert a number: ")) # Furst we made a variable that will get a number from the user.

for i in range(1, 10): # Then we made a loop that will multiplay the inserted number by 1 to 10 using the 'range' method.
    print(number * i) # And at last we print the results.
